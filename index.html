                <!-- Mission statement - make this reflect CV (but be unique) -->
                <p>Hi, I'm Dan Harris, a programmer who is passionate about designing and developing games in both Unity and Unreal Engine. As well as pretty much anything that I can program.</p> 
                <p>I am currently a final year student completing a Computer Science (integrated) Master's degree from Lancaster University, and expecting to graduate this summer with First-Class (Hons) degree (current average: 1:1).</p>
                <p>As well as this, I am also a student researcher at the university, being the primary contributor and author of a paper recently submitted to an international conference (CHI 2022) - in collaboration with academics from Lancaster University and the Eindhoven University of Technology.</p>
                <p>In my spare time I enjoy programming, developing and playing games, as well as hiking and being a hobbyist photographer.</p>
                <br>
                <p>On this site you will find an assortment of both games and other <a href="#projects-section" class="p-links">projects</a> I have developed, in addition to my <a class="p-links" href="CV.html">résumé</a>.</p>

                <h2>Experience</h2>
                <p>I recently completed a 10-week placement within the Lancaster Constabulary, acting as the sole developer of a VR experience that will be used to train officers in how to conduct digital investigations and interact with digital devices found at crime scenes.</p>
                <p>I have considerable experience developing games and games / interactive systems in Unity and Unreal Engine as a solo developer, as well as having worked as part of a team to develop a number of game projects, both within and outside of university. </p>
                <p>In my spare time I also enjoy completing online courses to enhance my skillset, such as:</p>

                                            conference, as well as my BSc dissertation. It is primarily concerned with allowing 3D
                                            objects in AR to be manipulated with Six Degrees-Of-Freedom (6DOF) using simple touch
                                            gestures, without sacrificing granular control. The key aspects of this project are:</p>

                                        <p>The interaction system is unique in the fact that it supports 6DOF manipulation using simple

                                        <p>The game created when following this course is a Diablo style RPG, using mouse controls, to
                                            move around, pick-up objects and attack enemies. With the key features of the game
                                            including:</p>
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>A combat system which supports multiple weapons and animations, including both melee and
                                                projectiles</li>
                                            <li>Player progression system (stat improvements based on XP gain)</li>
                                            <li>Enemy AI behaviour (e.g. following pre-defined routes, custom chase and attacking
                                                behaviour)</li>
                                            <li>A variety of enemy types built using a modular system</li>
                                            <li>Modular weapon creation and pick-up system</li>

                                        <p>Completing the course helped to further improve my knowledge of design and programming
                                            patterns, which I have taken forward into future projects (e.g. VR Training House), enabling
                                            me to create optimised and maintainable code. It has also given me insight into developing a
                                            larger project and how to build strong foundational systems that effectively support future
                                            expansion.</p><img src="./Images/RPG Pickup.gif" loading="lazy">

                                        <h3>Overview</h3>
                                        <p>This was an exploration into developing a website from scratch using HTML, CSS, and JS,
                                            without making use of frameworks such as Bootstrap or JQuery. The most unique aspect about
                                            the site is that it utilises two JSON files to store and dynamically create new project
                                            cards, and their content, making adding new projects to the site far easier.</p>
                                    </div>
                                    <div class="modal-desc-section">
                                        <p>The website is currently being hosted using GitHub Pages and is linked to a custom domain
                                            "DanHarris.Online". Testing before deployment is done using node.js and the "live-server"
                                            addon.</p>

                                        <h3>Project Description</h3>
                                        <p>I decided to not use any web frameworks or cite builders to build this website as I thought
                                            it would be an interesting challenge and allow me to improve my knowledge of HTML, CSS and
                                            JS. The website is inspired by several other portfolio sites, with the design and layout
                                            also being heavily influenced by that of the Steam Deck website.</p>
                                    </div>
                                    <div class="modal-desc-section">
                                        <p>The most notable aspect to the website is its dynamic loading of project data, with all
                                            project cards, and their content being loaded from two JSON files. A JS script I developed
                                            parses the JSON files and automatically creates the project cards and its contents
                                            (displayed in the modal), with the idea being to make adding new projects to the website a
                                            painless process.</p>

                                        <p>Whilst it currently is at an acceptable state, I still plan on improving the code as well as
                                            iterating upon its design and functionality. For instance, I intended for the dynamic
                                            project loading to allow for even more elements and an even more flexible design of the
                                            project card / contents. I also plan on creating the functionality for me to upload a text
                                            file and for the website automatically parse it and add it to its respective JSON file,
                                            making the addition of projects even easier.</p>
